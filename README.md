## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A big thing I began to learn during this project was using and manipulating SVGs. I edited one of the provided SVGs to match my personalized colour scheme, as well as added in a completely new SVG background image for the hero section.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to get more experience with creating mobile versions of pages, as I think the code ended up messy to get everything the way I wanted it after already setting up the regular style sheet.

For this specific project, I plan to continue to work on it - make it cleaner, add JavaScript for the mobile menu functionality, and potentially replace the bottom button with an email input form for a fictional newsletter.
